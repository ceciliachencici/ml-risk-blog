Welcome to my GitHub Page! Here, I showcase projects that combine machine learning, deep learning, and applied research to solve real-world challenges.

I focus on developing scalable and production-ready models, leveraging transformers, clustering algorithms, and advanced statistical methods. My work spans fraud detection, risk profiling, and data-driven decision systems, with applications in e-commerce, finance, and beyond.

**ðŸ”¬ Key Areas of Work**

**Deep Learning for Risk Detection**
Transformer-based models for fraud and anomaly detection in large-scale behavioral data.

**Scalable ML Systems**
Multi-GPU training, distributed systems with Ray Core, and optimized model deployment for real-time applications.

**Applied Research**
Novel methods in sequence modeling, embeddings, and clustering to uncover hidden patterns in complex datasets.
